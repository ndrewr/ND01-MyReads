# MyReads

A project built in fulfillment of Udacity's React Developer nanodegree program.
Lets users view lists of books organized in several categories: books they are currently reading, books they would like to read in the future and books that they have already read. Books can be moved between categories. A search feature allows the User to add additional books to any of these categories.

Uses React in combo with MaterialUI to create the views and a custom backend with limited search query functionality.

Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
